# Multi-Leap
**Multiple Leap Motion controllers on the same computer.**

Uses WebSocket clients and Leap Motion wrapper classes to allow multiple Leap Motion controllers to be used with a single computer.

Current version is programmatically coupled to a project that I am using it for. I will generalize it when I am finished my master's degree in the coming year.
